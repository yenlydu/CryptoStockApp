## Project description

- Crypto-currency portfolio application (basic operation such as sell/buy)
- Profile page with the summary of the amount of crypto-currencies acquired by the user represented in the form of Charts
- Localizing the app (french, english - US, dutch)
- JSON format for the currencies
- Updating datas according to the localization (for example, for the english - US the data format and device will be different)
- Bonus : Firebase implementation (still in progress, will be use to avoid storing locally the user's amount of crypto-currencies he owns), language change intra application (passing from french to dutch without reloading the application), currency change intra application (passing from dollar), display currencies last sold/bought
